I’d like you to create a **Prompt Construction Kit** in Markdown. This should be a structured collection of prompts that I can easily copy from my Obsidian workspace to generate well-structured testing prompts tailored to my needs.

The kit should include different sections with reusable prompt templates, ranging from simple to more advanced ones. For example, it should have fields where I can copy more detailed prompts, like:

- **Basic Prompt:**  
    _"For the following prompt, I have appended some files that you need to review to understand the topic."_
    
- **Test Case Generation:**  
    _"Please help me write test cases for this functionality."_
    
- **Technology-Specific Testing:**  
    _"Be sure to follow FastAPI's conventions to ensure that these tests are fully compatible and up to standard with the current tech stack."_
    

The idea is to have a structured and well-organized Markdown file where I can easily grab the necessary prompt format.

Be Sure to provide the output you in a **Markdown (.md) file** so I can download it directly from here. Thank you!!!
